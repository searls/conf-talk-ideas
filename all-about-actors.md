# All About Actors

Conferences: RubyConf 2015 & CodeMash 2016

## Title

All About Actors

## Abstract

After reading the abstract, I imagined an opening like this: "How can you tell if someone loves Actors? Don't worry, they'll tell you! But what even is the Actor pattern and why does it generate so much excitement?" -- based only on my own experience of an almost obnoxious level of zeal I see in Actor fans.

Line notes:

> Concurrency is one of today's hottest topics and actors are one of the hottest concurrency models.

Pull actors forward in this sentence, for some reason my eyes glossed right over the word "actors" and it was the point of the sentence.

> It's the default concurrency mechanism in Erlang, Elixir, and Scala, among others.

Scala's always big at Codemash, so good to mention it.

> In this presentation we'll take a look at the actor model as it has evolved over the decades. That's right--decades.

Maybe a more in-depth sounding verb phrase than "take a look at" since you'll be covering a lot of history. I'd throw a "!" at the end.

> We'll begin with its inception in the early 1970's, discuss the various--and often contested--characteristics, and do a survey of several modern implementations.

I think the most interesting part of the sentence is "and often contested", but it's thrown in as an aside. I'm interested to see what those are, but a more provocative tease (if you know one) might hook me better.

> We'll end by by looking at sample programs written in several different languages and frameworks.

For a conclusion I'd rather hear about how it's going to change my life and forgive my sins where I live in non-Actor-land
