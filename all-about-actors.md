## Title

All About Actors

## Abstract

Concurrency is one of today's hottest topics and actors are one of the hottest concurrency models. It's the default concurrency mechanism in Erlang, Elixir, and Scala, among others. In this presentation we'll take a look at the actor model as it has evolved over the decades. That's right--decades. We'll begin with its inception in the early 1970's, discuss the various--and often contested--characteristics, and do a survey of several modern implementations. We'll end by by looking at sample programs written in several different languages and frameworks.
