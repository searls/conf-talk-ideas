# Functional Is the New Black -- RubyConf 2015 & CodeMash 2016

## Title

Functional Is the New Black

## Abstract (CodeMash)

F# and Clojure and Haskell oh my! It seems like functional programming languages are everywhere these days. That's cool if you're into lambda calculus, monads, currying, and list comprehensions. But what if you're building real production applications for real customers? What if you happen to like object orientation? What, pray tell, does functional programming have to offer you? Probably a lot, actually, now that functional programming features are being incorporated directly into mainstream object oriented languages. In this session we'll explore the main ideas of functional programming and show how these ideas can be used to simplify several common object oriented patterns. We'll see code examples in C#, Java, Ruby, and JavaScript.
