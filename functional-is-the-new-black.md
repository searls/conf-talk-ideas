# Functional Is the New Black

Conferences: RubyConf 2015 & CodeMash 2016

## Title

Functional Is the New Black

## Abstract (CodeMash)

F# and Clojure and Haskell oh my! It seems like functional programming languages are everywhere these days. That's cool if you're into lambda calculus, monads, currying, and list comprehensions. But what if you're building real production applications for real customers? What if you happen to like object orientation? What, pray tell, does functional programming have to offer you? Probably a lot, actually, now that functional programming features are being incorporated directly into mainstream object oriented languages. In this session we'll explore the main ideas of functional programming and show how these ideas can be used to simplify several common object oriented patterns. We'll see code examples in C#, Java, Ruby, and JavaScript.

> Erlang and Clojure and Haskell oh my! It seems like functional programming languages are everywhere these days. 

"oh my" and "everywhere these days" are a little worn out. I'd search for a catchier turn of phrase in both cases.

> That's cool if you're into lambda calculus, monads, currying, and list comprehensions. But what if you're building real production applications for real customers? 

I wonder how condescending this will read to some readers. I certainly get your point because the light bulb still hasn't gone off for me, but I wonder whether the "you can't use Lisp at work, silly!" line of jokes is past its expiration date with a lot of folks.

> What if you happen to like object orientation? What, pray tell, does functional programming have to offer you?

If the previous line was interpreted as condescending, using "pray tell" here will look patronizing I worry.

> Probably a lot, actually,

I really like this turn of phrase for the contrast with the pessimisstic intro. I'd make it pop with newlines before and after and put a period on it.

> now that functional programming features are being incorporated directly into mainstream object oriented languages.

If you do the above, I guess this would become "In fact, â€¦". It's a good point. Since this is for RubyConf, is this true of Ruby? Is Ruby getting more functional features, are people merely discovering what it does have,  or is there a lib that's making it easier to adopt (like _.js did for javascript?)

> In this session we'll explore the main ideas of functional programming and show how these ideas can be used to simplify several common object oriented patterns. We'll see code examples in Ruby and JavaScript.

Sounds good. Looks like you're angling this as an "intro to functional" talk aimed primarily at skeptics. Given the worries at the top, the challenge will be to clear the CFP with reviewers who might for all we know be sympathetic to functional langs, so being more concrete about "hey maybe you hate this stuff but look it's kinda cool" narrative will be less adversarial
