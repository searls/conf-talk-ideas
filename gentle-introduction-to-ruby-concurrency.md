A Gentle Introduction to Ruby Concurrency

## Abstract

Concurrency is one of today's hottest topics. You can't throw a virtual stick these days without hitting a book, blog post, or conference talk about concurrency. Although there's a ton of information out there, it's often deeply technical, highly academic, or both. Most programmers don't care about the inner workings of the various interpreters or the advantages of one locking model over another. Most Rubyists just want to know one thing: How will this make my programs better? This introductory presentation will show that with only two simple patterns and abstractions virtually any Ruby program can be enhanced with safe, reliable, and easy to use asynchronous behavior.
